# Garmin Chat Desktop

> AI-powered fitness assistant for your Garmin Connect data

Chat with your Garmin data using natural language. Ask questions about your workouts, sleep, activities, and trends - all powered by AI.

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

**Garmin Chat Desktop** is a standalone Windows application that lets you have natural conversations with your Garmin fitness data. Instead of navigating through charts and menus, just ask questions like:

- *"How did I sleep last night?"*
- *"What were my activities this week?"*
- *"Show me my heart rate trends"*
- *"How many steps do I average per day?"*

The app uses AI (powered by xAI's Grok) to understand your questions and provide insights from your Garmin Connect data.
